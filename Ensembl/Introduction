Enter the ensembl page and search for the url we are doing the program.
http://rest.ensembl.org/ in order to search for the endpoints we are looking for
We use the end point that is in the web in order to connect the program with the web
Once is done we have all the data from that endpoint in order to search the one we are looking for
We create the program and the index.html and f.html connecting the three of them
And finally in our web we just introduce the parameters, connects with ensembl ans gives the data in that position from the endpoint
